Explanation of the **useMemo()** Hook in a React Component

This is a functional React component that demonstrates the usage of the **useMemo()** hook to optimize performance by memoizing values that take a long time to compute.

The component contains a slow function **slowFunction()** that simulates a computationally intensive operation that takes some time to complete. It takes a number as input and returns the double of that number after a long loop.

Inside the component, there are two state variables: **number** and **dark**.

- **number** is initialized to 0 and is updated whenever the user enters a new number in the input field.
- **dark** is initialized to false and is toggled whenever the user clicks on the "theme" button.

The **doubleNumber** variable is used to store the result of the **slowFunction()** after passing the current value of number as an argument. Since **slowFunction()** takes a long time to compute, this can cause performance issues as it will be re-computed every time the component re-renders.

To optimize the performance, the **useMemo()** hook is used to memoize the **doubleNumber** value. By wrapping the slow function in the **useMemo()** hook, the result of the function will only be recomputed if the value of number changes, and not on every render.

Similarly, the **themeStyles** variable is used to store the styles for the div element that displays the double number. The styles are dependent on the value of dark. Memoizing **themeStyles** with **useMemo()** ensures that the styles object is only computed when the value of dark changes, and not on every render.

Finally, an useEffect() hook is used to log a message whenever the theme changes. This hook is dependent on the **themeStyles** variable and will be called whenever **themeStyles** changes.

Overall, this component demonstrates the use of **useMemo()** to memoize expensive calculations and improve performance.
